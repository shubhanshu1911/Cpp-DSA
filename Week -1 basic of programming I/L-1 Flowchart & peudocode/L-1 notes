# Thought process to sove a problem 
1. Understand the problem
2. inout values
3. Approach
    Problem --> solution(head) --> Rough solution(Flowcharts/pseudo code) --> source code(high level language) --> machine understandable language(complier)
# Algorithm : Series of steps to solve of a problem 
# Flowcharts : Graphical repesentation of an algo
`Components` :
> *Terminator block* : Starting and ending state of algo. Represtent by over shape.
> *Input/Output block* : It is used to read and print an input and output. Represented by parallogram block
> *Process block* : Calculation and initialion can be done here. Represented by rectangle.
> *Decision making block* : We give some condition inside this and it has two branches either yes or no. Respresented by Rhombus
> *Connector* : this represent a function. Represented by circle  
# Pseudo code : Generic way to represent an algo in Textual form
